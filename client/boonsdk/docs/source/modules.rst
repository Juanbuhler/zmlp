Analysis Modules
================

Analysis Modules are the building blocks for augmenting assets with AI-generated metadata.
You can apply Analysis Modules to Assets, during the initial file import process or
after Assets have been created.  BoonAI contains preconfigured Analysis Modules that expose AI
from vendors like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft.  You can also create your own custom
Analysis Modules by training Models within BoonAI.

The Analysis Modules API simple lets you browse the existing Analysis Modules, for custom
modules see the Models documentation.
